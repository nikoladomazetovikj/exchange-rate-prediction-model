# Exchange Rate Prediction Model

This repository contains a project for analyzing and predicting exchange rates (USD - MKD) using a Multi-layer Perceptron Regressor (MLPRegressor) from scikit-learn. The project involves data visualization, preparation, model training, and evaluation.


## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn pickle joblib tabulate numpy calendar
```

## Project Structure

* KursnaLista.xlsx: The Excel file containing the exchange rate data from 21.04.2020 to 21.04.2024.
* model_training.py: The main script containing all the code for data analysis, visualization, and model training.
* model_testing.py: Testing the model
* model.pkl: The saved MLPRegressor model

## Usage

To run this project, you can use Jupyter Notebook or any other Python environment
